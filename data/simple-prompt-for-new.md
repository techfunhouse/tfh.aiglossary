* *Terms distributed across beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels * Coverage across all categories from AI Fundamentals to Applied AI Domains Phase B: JSON Term Creation
* Each term formatted according to the provided schema * Accurate definitions suitable for multiple skill levels * Proper cross-references using the "related" field to link terms across categories * Meaningful tags for cross-cutting themes * Relevant aliases and abbreviations * MANDATORY: All reference URLs must be validated and accessible URL Validation Requirements:
* Every reference URL must be valid, relevant to the term in discussion, verified as working and accessible * References must point to authoritative, credible sources * Prefer official documentation, academic papers, Wikipedia, and established educational resources * No broken links, redirects to error pages, or inaccessible content * Each URL will be tested before inclusion in the final JSON * Mix of beginner-friendly and technical resources for each term Quality Standards:
* Accurate and authentic information * Proper categorization within the 12 defined categories * Rich cross-referencing to create an interconnected knowledge graph * Consistent formatting following the sample-terms.json structure *Verified, working reference URLs for every term. I am attaching the current state of the terms list as JSON. I will share a list of new terms- ensure that they are properly corss-referenced and not duplicated.
* The terms must be categoried to belong to one of the following 12 categoris (as appropriate)
Categorize them appropriately within your 12 categories:
- AI Fundamentals
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Deep Learning Architectures
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Generative AI
- AI Agents & Autonomy
- Knowledge & Retrieval Systems
- Data Engineering for AI
- Model Deployment & Operations
- AI Infrastructure & Ecosystem
- Ethics & Governance
- Applied AI Domains
* Each term definition must follow the schema:
```json
{
  "term": "Long-Term Memory",
  "category": "AI Agents & Autonomy",
  "aliases": ["Persistent Memory", "Historical Memory", "Experience Storage"],
  "definition": "The ability of AI agents to store, retain, and access information and experiences over extended periods, enabling learning from past interactions.",
  "related": ["Memory Systems", "Experience Replay", "Knowledge Retention", "Learning History"],
  "tags": ["long-term-memory", "persistent-storage", "experience-retention"],
  "references": [
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288",
    "https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/"
  ]
}
