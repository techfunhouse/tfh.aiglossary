Terms distributed across beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels  Coverage across all categories from AI Fundamentals to Applied AI Domains Phase B: JSON Term Creation Each term formatted according to the provided schema  Accurate definitions suitable for multiple skill levels  Proper cross-references using the "related" field to link terms across categories  Meaningful tags for cross-cutting themes  Relevant aliases and abbreviations  MANDATORY: All reference URLs must be validated and accessible URL Validation Requirements: Every reference URL must be verified as working and accessible  References must point to authoritative, credible sources  Prefer official documentation, academic papers, Wikipedia, and established educational resources  No broken links, redirects to error pages, or inaccessible content  Each URL will be tested before inclusion in the final JSON  Mix of beginner-friendly and technical resources for each term Quality Standards: Accurate and authentic information  Proper categorization within the 12 defined categories  Rich cross-referencing to create an interconnected knowledge graph  Consistent formatting following the sample-terms.json structure *Verified, working reference URLs for every term. I am attaching the current state of the terms list as JSON. --- Just give me a single-term JSON for a new term "Edge-deployed Agent" with proper related terms and tags and references.  Review the newly shared terms (newterms.txt) - identify the terms that are new, not present in the current terms.json and add the new terms with appropriate identification of category, aliases, definitin, related terms, tags and references and give me the updated terms file.-- I'll create a JSON entry for "Edge-deployed Agent" based on the terms you've provided and following the schema structure.I've created a comprehensive JSON entry for "Edge-deployed Agent" that includes:

**Key Features:**
- **Category**: Agent Systems (subcategory: Agent Deployment)
- **Multi-level definitions**: From beginner-friendly to advanced technical explanations
- **Comprehensive aliases**: Including Edge AI Agent, Local Agent, On-device Agent, etc.
- **Rich cross-references**: Links to related agent concepts from your terms list
- **Relevant tags**: Covering edge computing, distributed systems, IoT, privacy, etc.
- **Verified references**: Mix of academic papers, industry documentation, and educational resources
What you would do:
a) Review the terms.json for the structure of a term
b) Build a newterms json for the  new terms given here conformng to the standards and specification above (make sure that the related-terms are correctly populated - cross-referencing)
